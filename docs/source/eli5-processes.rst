Processes ELI5
===============

This is a high level overview (explain me like I'm five).

General overview ELI5
---------------------

A process is a simple C structure, which contains
a :ref:`heap <def-heap>`,
a :ref:`stack <def-stack>`,
:ref:`registers <def-registers>`,
and an instruction pointer. Also, there are some extra fields for exception
handling, tracing etc. A new process is this structure created with a minimal
size heap.

Execution
`````````

Every new process is assigned to a :ref:`Scheduler <def-scheduler>`.
Scheduler picks one process from the queue and takes its instruction pointer.
Then scheduler executes one instruction and loops. After certain amount of work
done (:ref:`reductions <def-reduction>`) scheduler will place the current
process to the back of the queue and select another one. This allows some sort
of fair scheduling: every process gets CPU time no matter how busy were other
processes in the queue.

Messages
````````

Sending a message to a process is simple â€” this is how VM does it:

1.  Lock the process mailbox (or don't, if running on a single core).
2.  Copy message to destination process heap.
3.  Add the resulting term to process mailbox.
4.  Unlock the mailbox.
5.  If the process was sleeping in a receive, it would return back to
    scheduling queue and wake up when possible.

A process waiting for a message (in receive operator) is never queued for
execution until a message arrives. This is why millions of idle processes can
exist on a single machine without it breaking a sweat.

Messages are stored in the heap or in a heap fragment, and are chained together
using a single linked list.

Killing and Exiting
```````````````````

Killing a process is like sending it an exit exception. The process wakes up
from sleep, receives CPU time, and discovers an exception. Then it will either
:ref:`terminate <def-terminate>` or catch the exception and process it like
a regular value. An unconditional ``kill`` signal works similarly except that
Erlang code cannot catch it.

Load balancing ELI5
-------------------

By default BEAM VM starts one Erlang scheduler per CPU core. Processes get a
scheduler assigned to them in some manner (for simplicity you can say it is
random). You can configure schedulers using flags ``+S`` and ``+SP``. Schedulers
can be bound to cores in different ways (``+sbt`` flag).

At runtime schedulers will compare their process queue with the other (namely
the previous one in scheduler array). If the other queue is longer, the
scheduler will steal one or more processes from it. This is the default
behaviour which can be changed. The balancing strategy and can be configured
with VM flags ``+S`` and ``+scl``. You could want to use as few cores as
possible to let other CPU cores sleep and save energy. Or you could prefer
equal spread of processes to cut the latency.

Stealing is as easy as moving a pointer from one array to another. This may
affect :ref:`cache locality <def-cache-locality>` when an active process
jumps CPU core.

Process Registry ELI5
---------------------

A global process table maps process identifier (pid) to a Process structure.
The reverse mapping is done via ``Process.common.id`` field which is
an :ref:`Eterm <def-term>` field containing pid. This way a process can always
be uniquely identified by its local pid. Remote pids are larger and contain node
name and internal node id, and they will have to be resolved on the node which
owns them.

Another global table (process registry) maps names to pid. You can reach it from
Erlang by using ``erlang:register``, ``erlang:unregister`` and ``erlang:whereis``
function calls.

Message Queues ELI5
-------------------

Message queue is a C structure which belongs in Process struct,
it contains :ref:`Eterms <def-term>`
sent to the process, while the term :ref:`boxed data <def-box>` will be located
in this process' heap. A pointer to position in the queue exists, and it is
moved forward, as BEAM opcodes for reading the mailbox are executed. When pointer
reaches end of the mailbox, it is wrapped and scanning is started over -- this is
why selective receive on very large mailboxes becomes gradually slower.

To send a message (on C level of VM source) you find process by name (using
registered names registry) or by pid (using global pid registry) and having
Process struct you lock it and manipulate its message queue.
